Infrastructure for Startups

This repository provides a scalable, extensible and incredibly cheap way to host your infrastructure anywhere on the web.

Unlike recent, and traditional monolithic infrastructures that come with a lot of convinience, and are beginner friendly,
this setup doesn't couple you to any company or a product, and keep you entirely decoupled from opinionated services,
and unnecessary abstractions.
