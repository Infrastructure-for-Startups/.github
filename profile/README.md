This repository provides a scalable, extensible and incredibly cheap way to host your infrastructure anywhere on the web.

Unlike recent, and traditional monolithic infrastructures that come with a lot of convinience, and are beginner friendly,
this setup doesn't couple you to any company or a product, and keep you entirely decoupled from opinionated services,
and unnecessary abstractions. 

Why:

* This setup is focued on [COGS](https://softwareequity.com/blog/cogs-in-saas/)
* It focuses on incredibly easy extensibility
* It doesn't couple you to any company or a services with unpredictable pricing
* It's been built with documentation being the first class citizen
